LSQ (Langue des Signes Québécoise), is a signed language that is commonly used in some parts of Canada like Québec and Eastern Ontario. 

Since I am deaf and I live in proximity in some very Francophone areas, I decided it only makes sense to learn LSQ.

So far, how is it going?
1. It has a considerable overlap with ASL. Is this good? Bad? I don't know. Only time will tell.
2. HOLY FRENCH MOUTHING. I am semi-illiterate/semi-literate in the language. I like to think my grasp of the vocabulary is somewhat decent, my grammar on the other hand? Questionable, tenious at best. That being said, oral French has always been an uphill battle for me...


So far, I've completed three introductory level classes. I'm planning on uploading my personal notes here for my own records and the interest of the wider public. I will be making constant notes on vocabularly, comparing and contrasting LSQ and ASL signs. I may occasionally cross-reference LSF dictionaries and my [ASL etymology dictionary](https://gupress.gallaudet.edu/Books/A/A-Historical-and-Etymological-Dictionary-of-American-Sign-Language).
